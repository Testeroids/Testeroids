# Testeroids

## Unit tests on Steroids.


Testeroids is a framework and a set of guidelines working in concert for great productivity in unit testing of .NET projects.

It takes advantage of the [AAA pattern (Arrange/Act/Assert)](http://www.arrangeactassert.com/why-and-what-is-arrange-act-assert/) and modern C# language features and tooling, such as [Aspect Oriented Programming](http://www.sharpcrafters.com/) and [ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/), to create an enjoyable unit testing experience.
